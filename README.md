# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for configuring a productive
development environment on macOS (Darwin). It includes configurations for:

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (with [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/))
- [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)
- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) (with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k))
- [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/)

## Features

- Consistent and portable shell, editor, and terminal experience
- Pre-configured plugins and themes for productivity
- Easy setup with symlinks or install scripts
